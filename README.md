    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_5.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
  
  After Installation
  
    sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy

    $ npm -v

    https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/

### libkrb5-dev

## Config File
  
  Create a new directory with the name of 'config' in the root directory. Add a 'default.json' file in this directory. This file is used to store API keys and various other variable configurations like : site-url, contact-form-email, etc.
  It needs to have the following format : 
  
      {
        "mailgun": {
          "auth": {
            "api_key": "<your-mailgun-api-key>",

          }
        },

        "hashids": {
          "secret": "<hash-secret-for-unique-id-generation>",
          "no_chars": 4,

          "clientSecret": "<fb-app-secret>",
